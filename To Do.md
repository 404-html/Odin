# To do
Here are all the tasks that are being planned

## Current Tasks

### Isaac:
* Add options to the waiting room
* Make end game screen with stats
* Improve and refactor networking

### Thomas:
* Improve options menu
* Show more card play/pickup animations
* Make indicators update after cards get played
* Capatilist animation
* Swap hand animation?
* Jesus Animation?
* "Your turn" messages and such

## Future Tasks

* Kick players out of the game if they aren't playing anymore
* Add a time limit for how long you can spend picking cards (Add to waiting room options)
* Extend waiting room options to allow to individually control cards
* Further balance out the gameplay

## Cards to implement
* Snowden card -- animate message
* Slavery card -- still trying to decide best way to implement
* Orange cards - like purples but rarer and isn't compatible with white cards either. Fuckin' orange m8 will be the rarest card of this category
* New colour variants of current cards (EG: fuckin' purple/white m8, barney card that lets you remove all purples, red/green/blue/yellow versions of +4, swap card)
* Spiny shell card (from mario kart) - Gives 10 cards to person with lowest amount
* Some cards that affect your/other people's ability to play cards (similar to dislexia, but could be simpler like "can't play black cards for 3 turns")
* Oof card - a worse version of the pawn card which literally causes you to pick up the pickup chain value when it's played (only way you can play it too)
* Card that forces someone to play one of the cards in your hand and continues the game from their turn
* Card that causes everyone else to only be able to play 1 card at a time for a limited amount of time. (Lightning?)
* Card that lets you play any card in your hand with it - maybe make it rainbow so it can go on anything

## Cards changes
* Jew card - something else.. Thief?
* genocide - just replace with skulls - keep the same name though
* slavery card - mind control card?
* Nazi card - a black card that lets you remove all your blacks, but can only be played on black to avoid being too OP. black hole?
* Elevator/CopyCat - change to rainbow instead of black to avoid confusion

Adjust Elevator probabilities

Animations that work?
- do justly seems to work fine
- Swap card seems to give your card away but you dont see it come back
- Jew card you don't pick up the card

These ones I pretty much want to change a lot of the animation:
  Elevator animation
  Swap Hand animation
  DoJustly does not animate removal
  Swapcard does not animate most of the shit
  That issue comes up when you fuck around with the nazi card - IT HAPPENS IF YOU DO MULTIPLE JESUS CARDS
